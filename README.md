# Flux-AI-Model-on-Runpod-with-SimpleTuner-with-L40-GPU
 to set up Flux on Runpod using Simpletuner or an alternative solution that efficiently operates on L40 for training purposes. The ideal candidate should have experience in configuring machine learning environments and optimizing performance for training models. This project requires attention to detail and strong troubleshooting skills to ensure a smooth setup. If you have a background in AI/ML and are familiar with these tools, we would love to hear from you!

Want to run flux at 3000 steps. Idea is to generate caption also on the same machine using florence and some sample images after the training. This should be triggered via api. 
==============
Python script to set up and run Flux on Runpod, with integration for SimpleTuner or a similar framework to train models efficiently on L40 GPUs. It also includes the functionality to generate captions using Florence on the same machine after the training phase, all triggered via an API.
Prerequisites

    Runpod Setup:
        Ensure you have a Runpod account and GPU instance configured.
        Install the required dependencies on your L40 instance (e.g., PyTorch, Flux, SimpleTuner).

    Dependencies:
        Install the following Python packages: torch, transformers, flask, and other specific libraries required by Flux and Florence.

    API Requirements:
        Use Flask or FastAPI for the API server to manage training and caption generation.

Python Script

import os
import subprocess
import torch
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from transformers import pipeline  # Example for Florence-based captioning

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configurations
MODEL_PATH = "./models/flux_model"
TRAIN_STEPS = 3000
CAPTION_IMAGES_DIR = "./images"
CAPTION_OUTPUT_DIR = "./captions"

# Ensure directories exist
os.makedirs(MODEL_PATH, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(CAPTION_IMAGES_DIR, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(CAPTION_OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)

# Function to train Flux with SimpleTuner
def train_flux():
    try:
        print("Starting Flux training...")
        training_command = [
            "python", "simpletuner_train.py",  # Replace with SimpleTuner training script
            "--model_name", "flux",
            "--output_dir", MODEL_PATH,
            "--train_steps", str(TRAIN_STEPS),
            "--use_gpu", "true"
        ]
        subprocess.run(training_command, check=True)
        print(f"Training completed. Model saved to {MODEL_PATH}.")
        return {"status": "success", "message": "Training completed"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}

# Function to generate captions using Florence
def generate_captions():
    try:
        print("Generating captions...")
        caption_model = pipeline("image-to-text", model="Florence", device=0)  # Ensure Florence is installed
        image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(CAPTION_IMAGES_DIR) if f.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'))]

        captions = {}
        for image_file in image_files:
            image_path = os.path.join(CAPTION_IMAGES_DIR, image_file)
            caption = caption_model(image_path)
            captions[image_file] = caption
            print(f"Caption for {image_file}: {caption}")

        # Save captions to file
        with open(os.path.join(CAPTION_OUTPUT_DIR, "captions.json"), "w") as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(captions, indent=4))

        return {"status": "success", "captions": captions}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}

# API Endpoint to start training
@app.route('/train', methods=['POST'])
def train():
    result = train_flux()
    return jsonify(result)

# API Endpoint to generate captions
@app.route('/generate_captions', methods=['POST'])
def generate():
    result = generate_captions()
    return jsonify(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

How It Works

    Training:
        The /train endpoint triggers the Flux training using SimpleTuner.
        Training configuration, such as steps and GPU usage, is specified in the script.

    Caption Generation:
        The /generate_captions endpoint uses the Florence model to generate captions for images in the CAPTION_IMAGES_DIR.
        Captions are saved to a JSON file in the CAPTION_OUTPUT_DIR.

    Deployment:
        Deploy the script on a Runpod L40 GPU instance.
        Start the Flask server to expose the API for training and caption generation.

    API Usage:
        Use POST requests to trigger training or caption generation.
        Example: curl -X POST http://<your_runpod_instance>:5000/train.

Additional Notes

    Flux Training Script: Replace simpletuner_train.py with the appropriate training script or configuration for Flux.
    Model Fine-Tuning: Update the script to include hyperparameter tuning or additional features as needed.
    Florence Integration: Ensure the Florence model is installed and optimized for your L40 instance.
